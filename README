2010 May 30. Monstercyb.org 2nd Edition.
HTML5 structure. CSS 2.1 selectors for character reactions.
Using pixel art with sticker effect in Photoshop.
Tested as playing well in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Camino*, Opera, IE8/7/6, MobileSafari (iPhone OS), webOS, Android, (and likely on other mobile platforms to which I don't have access)
* Camino search text input line-height rendering bug
* IE 6/7 search text input issues with fixed backgrounds with long text (not using it for now); prefer not to use container as workaround, so background image will shift when text overflows
* IE 6 doesn't support CSS adjacent selectors
